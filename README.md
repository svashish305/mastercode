A prototype on single raspberry Pi 3 model B using DHT11 Temperature sensor to predict normal temperature on the basis of threshold temperature set by our continously captured dataset by using machine learning algorithm, linear regression to plot the histogram showing the prediction graph of temperature vs time. We set up pi using Raspbian by headless setup on pc and used realVNC viewer to view the desktop, also using putty to ssh into the pi terminal.
